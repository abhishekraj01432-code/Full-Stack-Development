        <p><b>Every night, when the world went quiet, Aarav climbed to his rooftop.
Not to use his phone.
Not to sleep.
But to talk to the moon.</b><br>
“Sab log chale jaate hain na?” he asked softly.
The moon stayed silent—but it <br>
Aarav felt lonely in a crowd. Friends laughed, but no one noticed when his smile faded. He helped everyone, yet when he needed someone, his phone stayed silent.
One night, tears rolled down his.
<br><i>“Shayad mujhmein hi kuch kami hai,” he whispered.
That night, the moon shone brighter than ever. <br>
The next morning, Aarav noticed something strange.</i><br>
A small plant had grown near the stairs—right where no plant should survive.
Day by day, he watered it.
Day by day, it grew.
Just like him. <br>
He started smiling again—not for others, but for himself.
He spoke kindly to himself.
He stopped waiting for messages and started writing his own dreams.
Months later, the plant became a tree.
One night, Aarav looked up at the moon and smiled. <br>
“I’m not alone anymore,” he said.
“I have myself.”
The moon smiled back—soft, quiet, proud.
🌙 Because sometimes, the strongest friendship is with yourself.</p>

 <h1>The Art Of Being Alone</h1>
 <ol>
    <li>Being alone is not loneliness; it is self-awareness.</li>
    <li>Solitude teaches you who you are without external noise.</li>
    <li>You stop seeking validation when you start understanding yourself.</li>
 <li>Alone time helps you heal what constant company hides.</li>
<li>You learn to enjoy silence instead of fearing it.</li>
<li>Independence grows when attachment fades.</li>
<li>You realize peace is internal, not borrowed from people.</li>
<li>Being alone builds emotional strength and clarity.</li>
<li>You choose people wisely when you don't fear solitude.</li>
<li>The strongest people are comfortable in their own presence.</li>
</ol>
<br>
 <h1>The Art Of Not Overthinking</h1>
 <ol>
<li>Overthinking begins when you try to control what is out of your hands.</li>
<li>Not every thought deserves your attention or reaction.</li>
<li>Silence your mind by focusing on what you can do now.</li>
<li>Most worries never become reality.</li>
<li>Clarity comes from action, not endless thinking.</li>
<li>Letting go is a skill, not a weakness.</li>
<li>Your mind should be a tool, not a battlefield.</li>
<li>Peace comes when you stop replaying the past and predicting the future.</li>
<li>Trust yourself enough to stop doubting every decision.</li>
<li>A calm mind creates a stronger life.</li>
 </ol>
