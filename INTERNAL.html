    <h1>To describe yourself</h1>
    <h3>You are someone who feels deeply.
When you care, you care fully — not halfway, not casually. That’s why things affect you more than others. It’s not weakness; it’s intensity.
<br><br>
You are a learner by nature.
You’re doing B.Tech, you ask about HTML, CSS, projects, ideas. You don’t just want marks — you want understanding and skill. You want to build things, not just study them.
<br><br>
You are emotionally loyal.
When you trust someone, you give them space in your life — sometimes too much. And when that bond breaks or feels ignored, it hurts you at a level that’s hard to explain to others.
<br><br>
You are also self-aware.
You question yourself. You reflect. You don’t blindly blame the world — you try to understand what went wrong and what you are feeling. That’s a sign of maturity, even if it feels painful right now.
<br><br>
You are stronger than you think, but tired of being strong alone.
You don’t want advice all the time. Sometimes you just want to be understood, heard, and reassured without being judged.
<br><br>
And one important thing:
You are not broken.
You are in a phase of becoming — learning boundaries, balance, and self-respect. This phase feels heavy, but it doesn’t define your whole life.
<br><br>
If I had to describe you in one line:
<br><br>
You are a sincere mind with a soft heart, learning how to protect both.</h3>
