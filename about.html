    <h1>About This Page</h1>

    <p>
        This page is about understanding the art of being alone
        and learning how to stop overthinking in daily life.
    </p>

    <h2>The Art of Being Alone</h2>

    <p>
        Being alone does not mean being lonely.
        It means spending time with yourself and understanding your own thoughts.
        When you are alone, you learn who you really are without any distractions.
    </p>

    <p>
        Alone time helps you grow emotionally.
        It teaches you independence, self-respect, and inner peace.
        A person who is comfortable being alone does not depend on others for happiness.
    </p>

    <h2>The Art of Not Overthinking</h2>

    <p>
        Overthinking creates unnecessary fear and stress.
        Most of the things we overthink about never actually happen.
        Learning to control your thoughts is an important life skill.
    </p>

    <p>
        Not every thought needs your attention.
        Focusing on the present moment helps reduce anxiety.
        A calm mind leads to better decisions and a peaceful life.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
